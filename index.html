            <h3><i>Feb 2020 - Feb 2022</i></h3>
            <p>I was a self employed tester on special web platforms for testing. Platforms which I used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turkcell/Life:) - a series of test cycles for a messenger BIP. Made a test strategy in a team,

                <li>Yahoo Mail - an email service. The customer was interested in automation testing. I wrote a UI in
                    Webdriver

                    UI
                    appeared, then via Fiddler and Charles intercepted traffic and watched how the API interacted with
                    the
                    UI
                    part.</li>
